                <!-- STORY GOES HERE -->

                    <p>The average United States rate for overdose deaths per 1,000 from 2008-2013 is 16. In Portugal, the rate for overdose deaths per 1,000 was 0.44 for that time. </p>

                    <p>Portugal’s universal affordable health care system and drug decriminalization is the reason for this difference, Medical Doctor David Ores said.</p>

                    <p>Portuguese drug users “can go see a doctor or a clinic or something and not pay any money so they get care before they die,” Ores explained.</p>

                    <p>Portugal decriminalized substances in 2001. Seven years later, the drug overdose death rate was down each year with the exception of 2012.</p>

                    <p>In the United States, where drug possession is a felony, between 2008 and 2013, there was a steppening incline of drug overdose deaths.</p>

                    <p>Increasing sales of fentanyl—which went up each year—sparked the American incline in deaths, Ores said. Many people who consume fentanyl die from the drug, he added.</p>
